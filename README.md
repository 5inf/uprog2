uprog2: Universal Programmer for Linux

The programmer is designed and developed by Jörg Wolfram. See http://www.jcwolfram.de/projekte/uprog2/main.php.
More info can also be found in this forum thread on mikrocontroller.net: https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/411643

The software and schematic are licensed by Jörg Wolfram as "GPL (GNU General Public Licence) Version 3" [http://www.jcwolfram.de/projekte/uprog2/main.php].

This repository tries to mirror the software releases from jcwolfram.de and adds additional stuff such as a PCB layout and a 3d printable housing to allow building actual hardware.
